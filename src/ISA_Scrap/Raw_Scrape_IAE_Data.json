Commissioning is due to complete in 2021. Once it is operational the plant will act as a template for large scale commercial facilities.",
            "Additional Information": "Please see www.absl.tech and www.linkedin.com/company/advanced-biofuel-solutions-ltd.\r\n\r\nBiohydrogen is a low carbon fuel that does not generate any carbon emissions when it is used. The RadGas process delivers hydrogen at a lower price than competing technologies with far greater greenhouse gas savings.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is seen as the fuel of the future for sectors that cannot convert to electricity such as industrial high heat applications or heavy goods transport. Organisations such as Shell, BP and Air Products are investing heavily in hydrogen technology.\r\n\r\nLow carbon hydrogen can be produced by the following processes:\r\n\r\na.\tGreen Hydrogen is made by the electrolysis of water using renewable electricity.\r\nb.\tBlue hydrogen is made by reforming natural gas and sequestering the carbon dioxide produced in long term geological storage.\r\nc.\tBiohydrogen is made by reforming wastes and residues.\r\n\r\nEach of these technologies have their own strengths and weaknesses and each will play a role in decarbonising the energy sector. The key advantages of biohydrogen are:\r\n\r\n1.\tGreenhouse gas emissions associated with biohydrogen are low. When biohydrogen is combined with carbon storage it generates significant negative emissions.\r\n2.\tUsing fossil natural gas as a reference, GHG savings from biohydrogen can be three times greater than savings from green or blue hydrogen.\r\n3.\tBiohydrogen produced from wastes has a lower cost than blue hydrogen, which requires fossil fuel feedstocks, and green hydrogen, which has high capital costs.\r\n4.\tBiohydrogen production is constant across the year while biohydrogen production is intermittent, driven by the availability of renewable electricity.\r\n5.\tBiohydrogen is sustainable, renewable and forms part of the circular economy.\r\n6.\tBiohydrogen can be produced at relatively small scales to match demand as the market develops.\r\n7.\tBiohydrogen can be produced close to hydrogen consumers, avoiding expensive transport costs.\r\n\r\nABSL will demonstrate the production of biohydrogen at the Swindon plant. The facility can switch between biohydrogen and BioSNG production on demand. This flexibility will allow the plant to supply hydrogen projects as the market develops."

Biomass sawdust is pre-dried and then enters the steam explosion reactor in which it undergoes the steam explosion process. \r\n\r\nHammermilling after the steam explosion process is not required. After it leaves the steam explosion reactor it is post-dried and then pelletized (Knappskog). Arbaflame has most experience with biomass from local suppliers (spruce and pine).\r\n\r\nThe total accumulated production amounts 130 000 tonnes. The pellets are sold under the name of Arbacore. Arbaflame also licences its technology to external partners as Arbakit and is planning to build a full scale 200 000 tonnes per year plant. Several other projects in Europe, United States and the Pacific area are in different stages of development and amount to a total production capacity of 1 700 ktonne per year (Knappskog). Most of these projects are still in the early development stages. Arbaflame mentions that it can apply a co-funding business model as well as a licensing business model.\r\n\r\nThe Arbacore pellets have been tested in several large coal fired plants in Europe, and in total tested at 14 utilities (personal communications). The pellets have further been applied in a full conversion configuration in Ontario Power Generation\u2018s Thunder Bay Station in Ontario, Canada since 2017."

This results in a higher efficiency process which produces a high quality, stable and energy dense oil.\r\n\r\nBy using water to control the thermo-chemical reactions, the Cat-HTR\u2122 process operates at lower temperatures, using less energy, and retains more carbon in its products, compared to pyrolysis and gasification. This makes the platform well suited to our carbon-constrained world. By comparison, pyrolysis and gasification are uncontrolled reactions, resulting in a significant percentage of carbon from the feedstock ending up as either solid char or gas (CO2).",

The plant will produce annually 60 million liters of bioethanol, 19 000 tons of furfural, 11 000 tons of acetic acid, and 144 gigawatt hours of green energy.\r\n\r\nThe plant\u2019s central processes will be based on Chempolis\u2019s patented formicobio technology. Chempolis\u2019s competitive technological advantage is a higher refining value from biomass, such as a better yield of ethanol as well as clean, marketable by-products, such as furfural and acetic acid. At the same time, the technology offers lower operating costs and, being energy net-positive, is environmentally friendly.",
            "Additional Information": "Construction of the bio-refinery began in early 2019, wherein the plant was expected to commission by April 2022. However, requirement to undertake certain changes in the project scope coupled with the execution delays that were faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the plant\u2019s expected commissioning date to April 2023."

After concentration of the sulfite spent liquor (SSL) in the evaporation plant it is incinerated in the combustion boiler to produce steam and electricity, whereas magnesium oxide and sulfur dioxide are recycled to produce new cooking liquor. The concept for the production of ethanol is to ferment the wood sugars from SSL and to distil off the ethanol in the distillation plant. Afterwards the 96% ethanol is dehydrated by molecular sieves to get water free absolute ethanol. The mash will be recycled as described above."

Unlike other CHP technologies which are based on the combustion of biomass, and require a working medium, (water in a steam turbine, heat oil in the ORC-process) wood gas cogeneration requires no intermediate medium thus resulting in a higher electrical efficiency throughout the entire system."

            "Technology Brief": "The technological key ingredient of the process chain is a thermal conversion process turning waste materials into syngas which in turn can be converted into a variety of energy carriers such as green fuels, green gas, and green hydrogen. If the feedstock is renewably sourced (wood, wood waste, sewage sludge, biogenic waste, etc.), the final products are equally 100% renewable. Non-renewable residues such as non-recyclable plastics can also be processed. While less sustainable than the carbon from renewable feedstock, the carbon from non-renewable feedstock would be upcycled for multiple usage-cycles, similar to the system of paper recycling.\r\n\r\nThe gasification technology is highly flexible, enabling the production of a broad range of potential end products: not only can it be used to produce sustainable fuels for transport sectors in which batteries are generally unsuitable (e.g. agriculture, long haul transport, aviation), but the same technology can also be used to produce green gas for the natural gas grid, or green hydrogen for future mobility solutions and industrial applications.",
            "Additional Information": "The Waste2Value project is driving the use of waste residues to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. The project focuses on waste fuels such as sewage sludge, residues from the pulp and paper industry, and mixtures with waste wood. In a second process step, the syngas is synthesized into liquid fuel (high quality diesel and kerosene). The current stage of the project runs to 2023 and covers construction and start-up of the pilot facility to gain the relevant operational experience."

The collected findings have been incorporated into the planning of this pilot plant. The pilot scale represents an important if not the most important milestone on the way to a demonstration facility.\r\nThe pilot plant consists of a gas cleaning section for purifying the synthesis gas to sulfur levels less than 10 ppbv. The gas is cleaned from aromatic compounds, sulfur, NH3 and water. The cleaned gas is subsequent compressed to a maximum pressure of 25 bar. The compressed gas enters the second part of the pilot plant, the synthesis part. H2 and CO are converted into a broad range from CH2- compounds ranging from C1 (methane) to more than C60.",

Heat from the engine is used for the integrated drum dryer to dry fuel. The feedstock is forest wood chips with a typical moisture content of 40-55% of the total weight.\r\n\r\nHeat for district heating is produced at three points in the plant:\r\n-\tCooling water from the gas engine\r\n-\tCooling of product gas in heat exchangers\r\n-\tHeat from cooling and condensation of flue gas.\r\n\r\nThe plant is designed for unmanned, automatic operation and has a nominal overall efficiency of 86%.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of having a small CHP plant is that the production of electricity and heat can take place close to the forest areas where the wood for the chip production grows. It reduces the need for road transport of biomass - and thus the CO2 emissions of trucks.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plant have been in unmanned operation in 2017. Minor technical challenges in combination with lack of further funding forced the company to cease activities in the last part of 2017. The plant has been dismantled."

            "Technology Brief": "The concept is based on three stages and the thermal integration between these to achive an indirect gasification resulting in a tar-free, MCV gas without using neither air nor oxygen.\r\nThe pilot plant has been operated stagewise with limited integration. As of late 2015, all the three stages process stages are fully integrated into a pilot plant representing the concept.\r\nThe wet  biomass fuel is first dried using flue gas in the lower temperature range from the combustion of part of the pyrolysis gas. In the pyrolyser, the fuel is decomposed thermally to pyrolysis gas and char, the heat beeing provided by the flue gas from the combustion of the pyrolysis gas in the higher temperature range.\r\nThe char is milled and injected as a powder into the gasifier by steam. The gasifier operates at very high temperature. The heat required for the gasification of the char is provided indirectly by burning the pyrolysis gas in recuperative burners, transferring heat by radiation to the gasification chamber. \r\nIn this way, the char is gasified with steam only such that the product gas is free from tar, low in methane and has no dilution by nitrogen such that it reaches an MCV heat content. The gasifier gas is then cooled to generate the steam required in the gasifier. \r\nThe hot flue gases remaining after the combustion is routed to the pyrolyser and then the dryer for indirect heating of these units.",

The reaction of catalytic conversion of ethyl alcohol to synthetic hydrocarbons occurs in gaseous phase in two stages.\r\nThe first stage is a strongly endothermic reaction of alcohol decomposition which produces ethylene and steam. \r\n\r\nThe next stage consists of complex strongly exothermic reactions of synthesis of hydrocarbons from ethylene. \r\n\r\nThe hydrocarbon mixture produced in the process is transferred to a stabilising column, where it is separated into a liquid fraction and a gaseous fraction. The liquid fraction is subsequently separated into individual products in a distillation column.\r\n\r\nThe entire process requires only a small amount of external energy. This both helps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases during the process and significantly improves performance indicators.\r\n\r\nThe technological process gives a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons of boiling point range of approx. 27-260\u00b0C and a mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nThe conducted studies have confirmed among others that the hydrocarbon mixture, in terms of the boiling point below 210\u00b0C, meets the quality requirements for liquid hydrocarbons intended for production of liquid fuels and/or liquid biofuels intended for spark ignition engines.",

The Sicily plant can process up to 750,000 tonnes annually of used vegetable oil, frying oil, fats, algae and waste by-products or from energy crops in desert or pre-desert soils for the production of quality biofuel. Furthermore, in March 2021, the new BTU (Biomass Treatment Unit) was launched and tested. It will enable the use of 100% of the biomass not in competition with the food chain, for example, used cooking oils and fats from fish and meat processing in Sicily. The aim is to create a zero-kilometre circular economy model for the production of biodiesel, bio-naphtha, bioLPG and bio-jet fuel. Castor oil will also be used to feed the bio-refinery, thanks to an experimental project to grow the plants on semi-desert land in Tunisia.\r\n\r\nAlso in Gela, a pilot Waste to Fuel plant is in continuous operation. Every day, it is fed by the OFMSW that the company collects as part of Ragusa\u2019s waste management service.\r\n\r\nGrowth will continue with the launch, in 2024, of \"Eni Biojet\" production at the Gela biorefinery, where a project is already underway for the introduction of a further 150 thousand tonnes/year of SAF from 100% renewable raw materials, capable of meeting the Italian market\u2019s potential obligation by 2025."

It allows for the production of sustainable H2 in synergy with refinery plants, therefore helping to reduce emissions linked to conventional waste treatment and conventional hydrogen production. With an on-site gasification system for hydrogen production, a GHG saving of 90% can be achieved compared to hydrogen production from steam reforming. The calculation of GHG savings is carried out on a life-cycle analysis (LCA) basis and takes into account the emissions avoided by using waste as feedstock for the Waste-to-Hydrogen project instead of as feedstock for a conventional waste-to-energy plant.\r\n\r\n1 Plasmix: non-recyclable plastic waste\r\n\r\n2 SSF: secondary solid fuel \u2013 fraction derived from sorted waste in mechanical-biological treatment plants"

A combustible gas, wood gas, is drawn from wood through a means of thermochemical processes which take place in a specially designed reactor. The raw gas is then separated of dust and tars through a filtering system. This cleaned gas is then used to produce combined heat and power through a gas engine + generator. Unlike other CHP technologies which are based on the combustion of biomass, and require a working medium, (water in a steam turbine, heat oil in the ORC-process) wood gas cogeneration requires no intermediate medium thus resulting in a higher electrical efficiency throughout the entire system."

Fulcrum has an extensive, global development program underway including the 33 Mgal/year Centerpoint biorefinery in Gary (Indiana, USA), and a similar sized project in the United States Gulf Coast region where the company is finalizing site selection.\r\n\r\nBy using SAF derived from residual domestic household and commercial waste, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced significantly on a lifecycle basis when compared to fuels produced from conventional crude oil. Such emission reductions are approximately 70% and have the future potential to be fully carbon neutral. In addition, SAF produced at the site offers a 90% reduction in particulates, which may benefit local air quality in and around airports."

To make drop-in alternative fuel from alcohols, the refinery must minimize differences in the alcohol-derived fuels and conventional fuels in physical and chemical properties. The three steps in the process include alcohol dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. These steps are already in use on a commercial scale.\r\n\r\nThrough dehydration, isobutanol is turned into isobutylene, a C4 building block, in a chemical process by stripping away the oxygen as water. Oligomerization turns the isobutylene into C8 and C12 olefins. The olefins have only one double bond and are readily hydrogenated to hydrocarbons. The resulting hydrocabons are distilled to ATJ and isooctane products. Isooctane is another marketable product, further diffusing the risk of investment in the process of producing ATJ.",

The gas produced is purified into a very hydrogen rich 'blue gas' (approx. 50% hydrogen) at approximately 950\u00b0C using water vapour. This hydrogen rich gas is concentrated into pure hydrogen or is used in gas motors to generate electricity. \r\nWith a thermal input of 13 megawatts the process yields 150 cubic metres of hydrogen an hour and 37,500 MWh p.a. of electricity.

            "Technology Brief": "Iogen technology makes it economically feasible to convert biomass into cellulosic ethanol using a combination of thermal, chemical and biochemical techniques. The yield of cellulosic ethanol is more than 340 litres per tonne of fibre. The lignin in the plant fibre is used to drive the process by generating steam and electricity, thus eliminating the need for fossil CO2 sources such as coal or natural gas.\r\nPretreatment: Iogen developed an efficient pretreatment method to increase the surface area and \"accessibility\" of the plant fibre to enzymes.  We achieve this through our modified steam explosion process. This improves ethanol yields, increases pretreatment efficiency, and reduces overall cost.\r\nEnzyme Production: Iogen has new, highly potent and efficient cellulase enzyme systems tailored to the specific pretreated feedstock. Iogen already has a worldwide business making enzymes for the pulp and paper, textiles and animal feed industries.\r\nEnzymatic Hydrolysis: Iogen developed reactor systems that feature high productivity and high conversion of cellulose to glucose. This is accomplished through separate hydrolysis and fermentation using a multi-stage hydrolysis process.\r\nEthanol Fermentation: Iogen uses advanced microorganisms and fermentation systems that convert both C6 and C5 sugars into ethanol. The \"beer\" produced by fermentation is then distilled using conventional technology to produce cellulosic ethanol for fuel grade applications.\r\nProcess Integration: Large-scale process designs include energy efficient heat integration, water recycling, and co-product production that make the overall process efficient and economical.  Iogen has successfully validated these improvements within its demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facility."

Valmet delivered the CFB gasification process, plus gas cooling and cleaning, steam boiler and flue gas cleaning system. The SRF is gasified at 850-900 \u00b0C in two CFB-gasifier units (2x80 MW) and converted into product gas, the gas is then purified and the resulting clean ecogas is combusted in an ordinary natural gas boiler. The raw material of the SRF is energy-containing waste.In the gasification of SRF, impurities, that cause boiler corrosion, are transferred to the product gas. The product gas is cooled from 900 degrees to about 400 degrees so that materials causing corrosion turn from gas into solid particles. Then, the solid particles can be filtered out so that the resulting gas is clean. The total fuel input of the plant is 160 MW; the power plant produces 50 MW of electricity and 90 MW of district heat for the city of Lahti."

The gasifier was commissioned in early 1998 and has since then been in commercial operation. The operating temperature in the reactor is typically 800-1000 \u00b0C depending on the fuel and the application. The fuel is fed into the lower part of the gasifier above a certain distance from the air distribution grid. The product gas for combustion is led directly from the gasifier through the air preheater to two burners, which are located below the coal burners in the boiler. The gas is combusted in the main boiler and it replaces hard coal in a 360 MWth boiler producing power and district heat. The annual gasifier availability has been over 95 % in each year and the Lahti plant has clearly demonstrated that the technology is technically proven and is able to reduce the emission of CO2, SO2, dust and NOx compared to coal-alone combustion."

            "Technology Brief": "The Chemrec process uses a refractory-lined entrained bed reactor in which concentrated black liquor (or black liquor + pyrolysis oil) is gasified under reducing conditions at around 1000\u00b0C.\r\nThe liquor is decomposed in the reaction zone into melt droplets consisting of sodium compounds, and a combustible gas containing H2 and CO.\r\nThe smelt droplets and the combustible gas are separated in a quench dissolver where they are simultaneously brought into direct contact with a cooling liquid. The melt droplets dissolve in the liquid to form a green liquor solution. The gas leaving the quench dissolver is cooled producing  steam. The cooling is done in counter current mode which means that the gas is efficiently washed of particulate matter.  \t The gas is then free of melt droplets and can be scrubbed for H2S removal and then used as a clean fuel or syngas.\t\tThe DME pilot  was installed in 2011. Since the end of the Chemrec BLG program and the Bio-DME project  in 2012, an industrially co-funded 160 MSEK R&D program was initiated in 2014 with the obejct ive of widening the fuel basis, develop new synthesis gas cleaning and synthesis reactror and catalyst technologies",
            "Additional Information": "Until May 2016 the plant has been operating as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tEntrained flow gasifier: 27 000 hours, most of the time with pressure close to 30 bar and fuel flow rate corresponding to 3 MWth. The oxidant has after initial optimization been nearly 100% oxygen (and small amounts of nitrogen for safety and purging purposes). In the spring of 2016 we co-gasified pyrolysis oil with black liquor for over 1000 hours. The pyrolysis oil came from two commercial plants in Finland (Fortum) and Holland (Empyro) and was transported in trucks to Pite\u00e5, Sweden.\r\n\u2022\tDownstream syngas train: 12 000 hours, more than 1000 ton DME. In the last few months of operation we extracted slightly more than 50 ton raw methanol for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe DME and methanol has been used in field tests by partners Volvo Trucks, Flogas and Perstorp."

Currently the refinery produces mainly Neste MY Renewable Diesel\u2122. The modifications to the refinery, an investment of approximately EUR 190 million, will enable Neste to optionally produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per annum as part of the existing capacity.\r\n\r\nNeste expects the project to be completed in the second half of 2023. This extends Neste\u2019s growing footprint in the Netherlands and demonstrates the shared sustainability ambitions of Neste, the Dutch government, and the Port of Rotterdam in particular. Together with the company\u2019s ongoing Singapore refinery expansion, Neste will have the capacity to produce 1.5 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by the end of 2023. Currently Neste\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel annual production capacity is 100,000 tons. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel\u2122, in neat form and over the life cycle, reduces greenhouse gas emissions up to 80%* compared to fossil jet fuel."

            "Technology Brief": "Our process is Power-to-Liquid (PtL). Renewable Energy is used to split water vapor (H2O) to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen. In this first plant, E-fuel 1, Hydrogen from electrolysis is mixed with carbon monoxide (CO) in the waste gas to form syngas, which is converted to normal paraffinic hydrocarbon liquids in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Hydrocarbon gas and unconverted CO2 from the FT-reactor is converted to syngas in a POX-rWGS-reactor, a combination of a POX reactor and a reversed water gas shift reactor.  In E-fuel 1, a modified POX-rWGS syngas reactor that converts 100% CO2 to syngas will be tested and qualified for use in E-fuel 2. E-fuel 2 will be able to use syngas from 100 % CO to 100 % CO2. \r\nFor E-fuel 1, the paraffinic FT liquids will be upgraded to wax or hydrocracked to jet-fuel and/or premium diesel in addition to some naphtha.",
            "Additional Information": "The E-fuel 1project is currently in the FEED phase and the FID date is expected to take place at the end of 2021 and production commence in 2024.3\r\nIf the demonstration is successful, the plan is to build E-fuel 2, a 150,000 t/y plant at the same location. Additional plants of similar sizes are also planned to be built in the Nordic countries after this."

After several successful biomass co-gasification trials with biomass input up to 30 wt%, the plant has been modified to co-gasify 30 wt% wood on a continuous basis. New biomass storage and feedings systems were put into operation in spring 2006. Since 2007, the plant has been operated with approximately 10% (energy) biomass. In 2011, activities were started to increase the co-firing share to 50% or more. In 2013 it was decided to close down the installation, due to low energy prices and relatively high cost of operation of the plant.",

            "Additional Information": "OMV continued its development efforts in the co-processing of renewable feedstocks. Adding a mixture of alternative and biogenic fuels to gasoline and diesel is an important issue at OMV. In many countries the legislation requires increasing percentages of biogenic fuels in gasoline and diesel. However, these admixtures can have an impact on engine and vehicle components. OMV is consequently investigating new co-processing technologies to increase the quality and stability of fuels with biogenic components. For traditional biofuel mixtures, the biogenic component is added to the fuel after production. Co-processing introduces the biogenic additive already in the production process."

For ORLEN Po\u0142udnie, the agreement supports the intention to realize a full scale commercial plant for the production of cellulosic ethanol from agricultural residues, which will further solidify the company\u2019s position as a forerunner in the Polish biofuels and bio-component technologies.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited by the continued interest in our sunliquid cellulosic ethanol technology and proud to have signed this second license agreement. It shows that our long-term strategic commitment to innovation and sustainability can deliver additional growth above and beyond Clariant's current strong portfolio\u201d, said Hans Bohnen, Clariant\u2019s Chief Operating Officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn line with our strategy, we consistently develop and strengthen the Group companies, including ORLEN Po\u0142udnie. We invest in modern technologies and focus on high-margin products, as they will be crucial to maintaining our leading position in the region in the coming years. At the same time, we do not forget about corporate social responsibility and we apply solutions that significantly mitigate our environmental impact,\u201d said Daniel Obajtek, President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board.\r\n\r\nThe license agreement enables ORLEN Po\u0142udnie to use Clariant\u2019s sunliquid technology for the project development and plant operation it is planning to execute at its Jedlicze site in southeastern Poland, utilizing available land and the integration potential with the existing Jedlicze petroleum refinery. It is planned that the annual production capacity will be 25.000 tons."

The raw gas is then separated of dust and tars through a filtering system. This cleaned gas is then used to produce combined heat and power through a gas engine + generator. Unlike other CHP technologies which are based on the combustion of biomass, and require a working medium, (water in a steam turbine, heat oil in the ORC-process) wood gas cogeneration requires no intermediate medium thus resulting in a higher electrical efficiency throughout the entire system."

The gasification plant was in 2008 moved to Toledo, OH, USA, for the purpose of a DOE Integrated Biorefinery (IBR) project started in 2010 the primary objective was to upgrade the 23 tonnes/day Red Lion thermochemical conversion (TCC) system and build a new liquid fuel production (LFP) system supplied by Greyrock Energy that directly converts biomass into diesel fuel.\r\nConstruction of the plant in Toledo, started in April 2012. Plant performance and validation tests were initiated in Q2 2012 and seventeen test campaigns were carried out until Q3 2013. The integrated IBR plant was operated on wood, rice hull and other materials for a total of 992 hours and the gasifier for some 200 hours in addition, excluding start-up and shut-down periods.",

The project originally was to be started in 2000. The 83 MWth gasifier is to convert about 150,000 t/y demolition wood, replacing 70,000 t/y of coal. The gasifier is a low-pressure Lurgi CFB operating at 750 - 850\u00b0C. Originally, the raw gas was to be cleaned from particles, ammonia, and tars before entering the coal boiler. This has been modified to the much simpler system where the raw gas is partially cooled to approximately 450\u00b0C and particulate reduction by cyclones. During commissioning, practical problems mostly related to the fuel supply system. After modifications and successful trials in 2005, the gasifier had to be stopped. In the Dutch interpretation of the European WID (Waste Incineration Directive), the complete coal-fired plant was identified in December 2005 as waste incinerator because of the demolition wood fired gasifier. This situation has been solved November 2006 by allowing wood gas on the national \u201cwhite list\u201d of clean biomass fuels under certain conditions related to the concentration of 9 heavy metals. The gasifier typically operates 5000 h per year.",

Wood chips are cooked with chemicals to separate the wood into its constituents, i.e. cellulose and hemicellulose (pulp) and lignin. Methanol is created when the wood and chemicals react. \r\n\r\nAfter cooking, the chemicals, lignin and other residues are washed out of the pulp. They form black liquor, whose water content is then reduced by evaporation. What remains is a condensate of methanol, turpentine and sulfur compounds. \r\n\r\nThe condensate is cleaned to be reused in the mill and then raw methanol is created, which is a mixture of combustible residues. In normal cases, raw methanol is burned to produce heat and energy. But thanks to a patented extraction process, we can now produce a commercial grade methanol product instead. For every ton of pulp that leaves our mill, we can produce about 10 kg of biomethanol."

The produced renewable fuels will significantly reduce the CO2-emissions compared to fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nThe new biorefinery is under construction on the St1 refinery site in Gothenburg and will have a total capacity of 200,000 tonnes of liquid biofuels. It is designed to optimize production of renewable HVO diesel and biojet fuel and to use tall oil-based feedstock. The joint venture will have access to SCA\u2019s tall oil, a by-product from the kraft pulp production at SCA\u2019s mills in \u00d6strand, Obbola and Munksund. The biorefinery will also be capable of using a wide range of other feedstocks and is expected to be operational in Q2 2023."

The gasifier is a 12 MWth CFB-unit, which has been running since the end of 2008. It started first as air-blown gasifier in order to produce only the raw gas for the lime kiln. In 2009-2011 the gasifier was mainly operated in the oxygen-steam mode to produce low nitrogen content gas for the BTL demonstration purpose. NSE biofuels Oy, a joint venture between Neste Oil and Stora Enso, opened a demonstration plant at Stora Enso\u2019s Varkaus Mill in Finland in 2009. The main goal was to demonstrate Biomass-to-Liquids (BTL) technology which is based on steam-oxygen blown CFB gasification followed by hot filtration and catalytic tar reforming. After completing the successful demonstration programme for Neste Oil and Stora Enso (supplier Foster Wheeler) in 2011, the plant was modified to air-blown operation.",

            "Technology Brief": "Topell Energy is a privately funded Dutch clean technology company that has developed a patent-protected process for the torrefaction of biomass. The company was established in 2008, with its headquarters in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands. Topell Energy has less than 10 employees, all of them dedicated to torrefaction. \r\n\r\nTopell Energy applies a fluidized bed technology. The technology is proven at a commercial scale demonstration plant in Duiven, The Netherlands. This plant was built in 2010 and commissioned in 2011. In 2012 the first product was produced and tested in several power plants. \r\n\r\nHowever, the plant was not operating at its design capacity. In the first half of 2013 Topell Energy implemented a redesign and in the second half of 2013 the plant was re-commissioned and ramped-up to its designed production capacity.\r\nIn a consortium together with utilities RWE, Vattenfall and GDF SUEZ, Topell Energy also completed a large scale co-firing test in the Amer 9 power plant of RWE Essent in the Netherlands. According to Topell, this test proved that Topell\u2019s pellets can replace coal in pulverized coal power plants, without the need for infrastructural changes at the power plant. \r\n\r\nTopell Energy has postponed the production at its demo plant in September 2014, due to the absence of a new co-firing support system for biomass in the Netherlands. The plant is currently mothballed.\r\n\r\nTopell\u2019s technology has been recognized as a breakthrough technology which enables large scale deployment of a biobased economy. The company has received awards from the Cleantech Group, the World Economic Forum, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the World Wildlife Fund and others.\r\n\r\nThe technology is now in the hands of Blackwood Technology, see http://www.blackwood-technology.com/"

The technological areas within the scope of the project are gasification, gas clean-up, gas conditioning, CO2 separation and liquid fuel production via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. Activities related to the technological research areas consist of the pre-design of the units, laboratory tests, detailed design, engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and testing at pilot scale. In the gasification step, two types of gasifiers circulating fluidized bed gasifier and pressurised fluidized bed gasifier have been studied in laboratory scale (150 kWth). 1.1 MWth capacity pressurised fluidized bed gasifier have been designed for pilot scale. The aim of the gas cleaning step is to remove impurities from raw gas of gasifier. Both hot and cold gas clean-up technologies have been used in laboratory scale experiments. Hybride hot and cold gas clean-up pilot system has been designed. The third step of project is gas conditioning. The aim of this step is to adjust H2/CO ratio in syngas and capture CO2. H2/CO ratio in syngas will be adjusted in a water gas shift (WGS) reactor and CO2 will be captured by chemical absorption technique. One of the main work packages of the project is the production of liquid fuels via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis since the activities related to both FT catalyst development and fixed bed and slurry phase reactor applications have been performed in this work package. Low temperature FT process with multi tubular fixed bed reactor will be used to produce synthetic diesel in pilot plant. Iron based FT catalyst has been developed to convert syngas into hydrocarbon chains. All units of the pilot scale system are under construction currently.",

Development of the right catalysts for upgrading of crude pyrolysis oil to advanced biofuel is a key task. The company is also developing its technology to enable commercial production of crude pyrolysis oil from agricultural non-food residues.\r\nIn the area of upgrading of the bio-oil, BTG has validated the feasibility of the co-processing of bio-oil and Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) in an FCC unit. BTG is also working on a 2-step approach, stabilization using Picula\u2122 catalyst and hydrotreatment using commercial catalysts (NiMo/CoMo). The company has four continuous hydrotreaters at lab-scale (~ 1 kg/day) and is commissioning a new a pilot unit (~ 50kg Fast Pyrolysis Oil (FPO)/day) for further process and catalyst development on hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oil (HORIZON2020 projects Fastcard, 4REFINERY, Waste2Road).\r\nIn addition, in 2018 BTG will also commission a new 3 tonnes/d demo plant for pyrolysis oil fractionation (ref. Bio4Products) for the development of bio-based products."

The plant is 100% owned by VERBIO North America Holdings Corporation.\r\n\r\nRNG production from corn stover began in December 2021 with the completion of Phase I, at a capacity of 7 million ethanol gallons equivalent (EGE) per year. Upon completion of Phase II in the 4th quarter of 2022, the site will begin operating as a biorefinery, producing 60 million gallons of corn-based ethanol and an additional 19 million (EGE) of RNG from stillage. The integration of RNG and ethanol production, unique to VERBIO, incorporates advanced operational technology currently practiced at the company\u2019s facilities in Germany. The process also yields humus, a soil amendment, and organic fertilizers.",
            "Additional Information": "Following the merger with DOW and the decision to leave the biofuels business, DuPont put the 30 MMgy (90,000 tonnes/yr) cellulosic ethanol plant in Nevada, Iowa, up for sale in the autumn of 2017. In November 2018 it was sold to Verbio North America Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of German bioenergy producer Verbio Vereinigte BioEnergie AG. Verbio is planning to convert the facility to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) from straw."

The bioethanol is produced at the Crescentino cellulosic ethanol plant, which has been adapted to temporarily use corn glucose syrup as feedstock.\r\nIn 2013, Beta Renewables officially opened its EUR 150 million industrial-scale second-generation ethanol plant in Crescentino, province of Vercelli, Italy. The plant EPC was carried out by Biochemtex, and is based entirely on the PROESA technology, also developed by Biochemtex. The plant design capacity was to produce up to 60 000 tonne-per-annum of ethanol from 270 000 tonnes of biomass as well as electricity to the grid. The assets and resources of Biochemtex and Beta Renewables were acquired by Versalis in November 2018"

The gasifier was an airblown CFB operating at approx 20 atm. \r\nDownstream of the gasifier and its associated cyclone, the gas was cooled to 400 C and then passed a hot gas filter in which particulateds were removed. The gas was then directly routed to either the flare or an SGT100 gas trubine. \r\nBleed air from the gas turbione compressor was used in the gasifier after pressure boosting. The exhaust gas from the turbine passed a HRSG generating steam at 45 bar 450 C and also some district heating before being released to the stack.\r\nThe steam was used in a steam turbine, after which there was a district heating condenser. The plant was operated in this way until 2000 when it was mothballed. \r\nThere has been several attempts to revive the plant for use as a steam-oxygen blown unit for synthesis gas production. The last attempt failed in  2011 for lack of industrial financing.",
